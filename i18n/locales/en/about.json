I am interested in the business aspects, for better understanding the overall value that needs to be carried from the idea to the end customer through design and development.",
    "second": "<b>Rather than rebuilding from scratch, I favor an evolutionary approach</b> to development, advancing projects without halting feature delivery.",

    "third": "While working with a team, I focus on training and development to strengthen skills and build a solid knowledge base for the project. I also streamline processes to improve efficiency. To keep everyone aligned, I establish asynchronous communication, so each member understands both their tasks and the overall goals, ensuring clarity and direction across the team.",
    "fourth": "At the same time, I do not forget about the result and tracking the overall performance of the team and the mood of its members. I have led development teams of up to 8 people."

    "first": "<b>10+ years in development and design</b>, able to create projects from scratch, develop application architecture and design complex interfaces. I have an interest in the business aspects to better understand the total value that needs to be carried from the idea to the end client through design and development.",
    "second": "<b>I like not to tear down and build everything from scratch</b>, but to form an evolutionary approach to the development of projects, not stopping the delivery of new features at the time of this transition.",
    "title": "Managing a development team for 3 years",
    "third": "When working with a team I am engaged in its training and development, I form the knowledge base of the project and optimize processes. I build asynchronous interaction between team members, in which everyone understands what needs to be done and why. ",
    "fourth": "At the same time I do not forget about the result and tracking the overall performance of the team and the mood of its members. I have led development teams of up to 8 people."
